To use the program in project 6, please open up terminal and go into your directory containing the code. Next please enter based on the following instructions:

ruby assembler.rb add/Add.asm

Now, you can change add/Add.asm to any argument you desire as long as it follows the same pattern.

For example:

ruby assembler.rb potatoes/Potatoes.asm

This will work if the files are contained in the same project.

Current state of progress for project 6, the assembler, parser and code files are working. It successfully passes the add hack tests and now the current work is adding in labels for the next part, max hack. After that, will need to complete the remaining in order to pass pong hack and finally complete project 6.

Thank you. :)
