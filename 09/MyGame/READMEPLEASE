Thank you for an awesome course!
Please take a look at the game I have created, but do keep in mind that it is not yet completed due to time constraints. I have implemented several features to the game, but not all of them are fully operational yet. However, I do plan on working on it after finals when I have some free time.

Now for the game -

I was inspired by a game I used to play a lot back in middle school, called 'bmtron.' It was a very addicting game I used to play with my classmates, even having competitions during class. Good memories were made during these so called in class tournaments. Thus, I decided to recreate that game but with an additional twist, having mindsweeper rules. Basically, you move around the board trying to avoid any 'traps' and these are invisible, so you have to rely on luck and not just skills. The longer you last, the more points you have. I was not able to create a timer feature as I could not find an api for it in Jack, so this is one feature I would have to make later on. The traps are also not fully complete, as I have only created 'three' lines of traps that the player must avoid. Eventually, these would be spread out the board and the player would be moving at various speeds based on time. A little ambitious game but I did try my best in building it, spent a lot of time trying to figure out the mechanics while juggling other work. I hope you like the game as it currently stands, though it would definitely be more fun to play once completed.
